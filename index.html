            <p id="text2">I graduated from Longwood high school five years ago in 2017. Most of my peers talk negatively about our time in highschool but I personally enjoyed it. I met some amazing people back then. Many of them I no longer speak to but some are my closest friends that I still continue to talk to every single day. After graduation, I spent a lot of time thinking about which college I wanted to to. I initially intended on going to Stonybrook University but after getting denied I had to explore my other options. After some deliberation I found myself at Farmindale State college. A small yet excellent school where I would remain for two years. I very much enjoyed my time at Farmindale. The schools small size meant that after a while I started to recognize a lot of the students and I eventually established a sense of comfort. The only real issue that I happened to have with Farmingdale was the distance. Farmingdale happens to be roughly forty minutes from my home and whenever there was traffic that was an additional twenty minutes to half hour added onto my commute. I dreaded that drive but overall I did not complain much due to the fact that I found the school enjoyable and the staff was very kind. After two years had passed I was eligible to transfer to Stonybrook so that's what I chose to do. I officially started as a student at Stonybrook in 2019 as a sociology major. I had taken a few sociology classes at Farmingdale and always enjoyed them so I figured I would major in the subject although I was unsure of what career path I would pursure later down the line. I was not too worried about that at the time thouogh. I was more so focused on just trying to adjust to my new envirenment. Stonybrook was a major change from Farmindale in that it was much larger and the classrooms were packed with students. When I was at Farmingdale, the normal class had around twenty students which is hardly different than a highschool classroom. At Stonybrook, I was suddnely placed in massive lecture halls that held approximately five hundred students. This change was overwhelming and put a lot of responsibiltiy on the students to pay attention to what was going on. I absolutely did not do that and as a result my grades in my first semester reflected that. I eventually got my act together however and graduated in the winter of 2021.</p>

                <p id="text3">Up until this point, I have not mentioned coding or anything close to it even once. It is not something that I considered a hobby nor was it something I pursued whille in my education. In fact, for a long time coding wasn't something I enjoyed and I was convinced that it was not for me. My very first time coding was in highschool. I had wanted to make an app that people could play on their phones. I thought it was a genius idea after witnessing the massive success of flappy bird. I craved success as well but with no programming experience I found myself stuck. I could learn how to do it myself but I knew that this would take a long time and I was in a rush. I did the next most logical thing and hired a programmer to do the heavy lifting for me. He followed my instructions very well and he made the game for me. The game (which I ended up naming rainbow rebound) successfully made it to the appstore and onto the phones of many of my firends. Something that I am proud of till this day. Despite everything going pretty well I still found myself somewhat unsatisfied. Although he programmer I hired did an outstanding job, I felt as though he failed to execute it exactly as I had envisioned it in my mind. It was in that moment that I realized that in the future, if I wanted my apps to come out exactly as I envision them, it is for the best that I create them myself. With that being said, I took my first steps into the world of coding. I booted up some free courses on code academy and got to work. It went terribly. I found everything extremely confusing and my code would break because of the smallest mistakes. It only took a few weeks before I decided that perhaps coding is not for me and that I should find a differnt path. I did not think I was smart enough for this one. I did not write another line of code for years. This changed far down the line, when Stonybrook demanded that I take a tech class as an elective in order to graduate. Initially, I signed up for a class about the solar system and the planets but after seeing how much math was involved I quickly got sick to my stomach and dropped the class as fast as I could. My only other option was an introduction to coding class that I signed up for with some reluctance but also with some excitement because although I knew how difficult coding was I thought to myself that maybe this time would be different since I would now get proper guidance. Unfortunately for me I had a very bad time. I found the class to be incredibly conufusing and not at all enjoyable. I did not realize this at the time but part of that is likely due to the fact that I was trying to grasp very confusing concepts while simultaneously juggling several other difficult classes. At this point I was very convinced that there was no way there was any future for me in anything related to coding. It wasn't until a major shift in my life happened that my mindset would change entirely.</p>

                <figcaption class="caption">My month long hospital stay</figcaption>
                <p>On January 1st of 2022 I recieved a phone call from my doctor. Her first question to me was whether or not I was alone. I was. She seemed unerved by this and politely requested that I call someone if possible. I knew immediately that something was very wrong. I called my older brother, quickly informed him of what was going on and connected the phone calls. She introduced herself to my brother and told us that I had cancer. Within just a few hours I was in the city at a hospital called memorial sloan kettering where I spent the rest of the month starting a very difficult chemo regiment that I would continue for the next eight months. Everything had happened so quickly it was hard to keep up but I endured and made it through and now I'm happy to be able to say that I am completely cancer free but the experience opened my eyes to many things. Most people know at least one person whose life has been affected by cancer in one way or another but no one would ever think they'd be the one to have it. I know I didn't. The experience showed me how fast everything can change when you least expect it and how incredibly fragile can be. Knowing this I decided that I would make the most of the time I have and be the best version of myself that I could possibly be and that means overcoming challenges that I once thought that I could not overcome. I used to think that coding was too hard for me and that I just did not have the mind that was capable of understanding it but after beating cancer I know for a fact that there is absolutely nothing that I can't overcome. Once my treatement had ended back in August, I stepped back into the world of coding through code academy. This time with a reinvented mindset and fully applying myslef in a way that I never have before. With this newfound determination I found that I actually enjoyed coding for the first time. Especially the excitement of overcoming a challenge that was at one point giving me a lot of difficulty. Once I realized that I am fully capable of learning these concepts I decided that this would be the path for me.   </p>
