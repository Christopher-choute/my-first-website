            <p id="text2">I graduated from Longwood high school five years ago in 2017. Most of my peers talk negatively about our time in highschool but I personally enjoyed it. I met some amazing people back then. Many of them I no longer speak to but some are my closest friends that I still continue to talk to every single day. After graduation, I spent a lot of time thinking about which college I wanted to to. I initially intended on going to Stonybrook University but after getting denied I had to explore my other options. After some deliberation I found myself at Farmindale State college. A small yet excellent school where I would remain for two years. I very much enjoyed my time at Farmindale. The schools small size meant that after a while I started to recognize a lot of the students and I eventually established a sense of comfort. The only real issue that I happened to have with Farmingdale was the distance. Farmingdale happens to be roughly forty minutes from my home and whenever there was traffic that was an additional twenty minutes to half hour added onto my commute. I dreaded that drive but overall I did not complain much due to the fact that I found the school enjoyable and the staff was very kind. After two years had passed I was eligible to transfer to Stonybrook so that's what I chose to do. I officially started as a student at Stonybrook in 2019 as a sociology major. I had taken a few sociology classes at Farmingdale and always enjoyed them so I figured I would major in the subject although I was unsure of what career path I would pursure later down the line. I was not too worried about that at the time thouogh. I was more so focused on just trying to adjust to my new envirenment. Stonybrook was a major change from Farmindale in that it was much larger and the classrooms were packed with students. When I was at Farmingdale, the normal class had around twenty students which is hardly different than a highschool classroom. At Stonybrook, I was suddnely placed in massive lecture halls that held approximately five hundred students. This change was overwhelming and put a lot of responsibiltiy on the students to pay attention to what was going on. I absolutely did not do that and as a result my grades in my first semester reflected that. I eventually got my act together however and graduated in the winter of 2021.</p>
